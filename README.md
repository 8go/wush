# wush

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/coder/wush.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/coder/wush)

`wush` is a command line tool that lets you easily transfer
files and open shells over a peer-to-peer wireguard connection. It's similar to [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole) but doesn't require you to
set up a relay server.

## Basic Usage

Install:
```
go install github.com/coder/wush/cmd/wush@latest
```
